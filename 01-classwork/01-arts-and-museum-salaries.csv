The pay rate was adequate for the time and I could have lived on it, if I had had more hours. I supplemented with other work but it was ultimately not sustainable, especially afterstudent loan payments began.  

A position of expanded responsibility and hours at SAIC was in the process of being created and my filling that position was informally promised. But, I did not have enough savings or free lance earnings for treading water as long as that process took. 

One of my classmates who was from the area got the job I worked to create, replacing me after I moved away from Chicago for my first full time job as an Art Therapist in my home town. Studying and working at SAIC was my “dream come true”.  Leaving because I did not have enough hours or enough of a financial reserve to weather the slow moving machinery of starting something new was heartbreaking. That the program I worked in as the first facilitator for autistic and special needs individuals to join in museum education outreach programs is still running 30 years later is certainly something to be proud of. A child I saw there at age 5 still attends every weekend on scholarship, as he has for the last 30 years. I still wonder what my life would be like had I been able to finance staying through the unpredictable stages of SAIC securing long term program funding. 

I’m so happy our wonderful program actually found the support it deserved and is running all these years later! But, I’m writing about this now as it might shed light on how individuals who invest heavily of time and expertise in starting good things deserve to be supported for their contributions as much as the institution itself and participants do. Adequate pay per contact hour is one very important thing. But there’s more to consider by way of fairness and sustainability inside arts institutions. Workers, in truth, are neither interchangeable or expendable. "

I left because the pay was not enough despite a raise structure and the government level/seniority system which gives one hope of security. There were options to move up and I was offered a position in administration but a position in art therapy came up at double the admin salary, plus the AT position had an academic schedule that provided more paid vacation time and summers off. Part of me still sometimes regret not staying at NGA even at the lower pay, the environment was just so great. But the longer I stayed the deeper the ripple effects of the low pay. Also, I had orthopedic issues in a position that required standing most of the time, lifting boxes of merchandise and other physically demanding tasks. Even with fair accommodations in place for appropriate-for-my age and condition duties the combination of factors was not sustainable. "

In these times there are great employee perks, like coffee, flexibility with work hours, freedom to explore, extended lunch breaks, happy hours hosted by senior staff members, small gifts like the ability  to leave early on holiday weekends, onsite Thursday yoga, and great talks with catered food for the public. The stronger the mission the better the organization. When the mission is obscure and funding runs out there is less of an ability to explore with as much leeway and freedom as before. It is harder to give staff raises and pay them for their hard work. Promotions are halted and only lateral moves are available. Perks that are easy to justify when there is lots of money are missed by staff members. When the going gets tough, the tough get going. It is hard to replace or retain valuable staff when the compensation is poor and staff members have other alternatives in greener pastures. With that said colleagues at the junior level were amazing, brilliant, talented people who have since moved on and are thriving in their new environments. "

After one adjunct (a young working mother) with five-plus years teaching experience and a robust national exhibition record left the department in protest, this process was supported again in writing by the dean of arts and humanities (David Snyder). Additionally, I was hired with two other new adjuncts in 2018 to replace a single full-time retiring faculty member in a blatant attempt to sidestep union requirement to provide partial health care / benefits for adjuncts with higher course loads. Rather than employing ""coin toss"" randomization, I observed the department giving repeated obvious class assignment priority to middle-aged white artists with dubious MFA's (in some cases low-residency), little or no college teaching experience prior to their hiring and spotty / non-existent exhibition records. This is an acute example but unfortunately is in line with my observations of numerous other art department's adjunct policies, from junior colleges to UC campuses and private four-years."

Even though my job includes scheduling the museum’s tours, helping train the people who give tours, and extensively supporting early childhood and youth and family education programs through developing, leading, training staff and volunteers, and coordinating programs, I have no guarantee of a job (due to lack of grant funding or lack of allocated funding) to past the end of my current 8 month contract.
