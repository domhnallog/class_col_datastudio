Okay, here we go! 

# How projects + mentorship works

You'll have a different project every week.

You'll have a different mentor every week.

Everything will be great, and it will all be done through:

* Google Docs
* GitHub
* [The mentorship site](https://lede-mentorship.herokuapp.com)

# Project Schedule

You're responsible for a new project every week, but I recommend working on projects in 1.5 week cycles. Your schedule might look something like this:

* **Every Saturday:** Finish your pitch for the next week, along with some preliminary data exploration and Python graphics
* **Every Tuesday:** First draft, including Illustrator
* **Every Friday:** Revised draft, published to your site*
* **Following Wednesday:** Final draft, updated on your site*
 
Yes, that means working on your new project while you're finishing your final draft of your old project, but I promise it'll be worth it! You can also use your mentor to discuss older projects to get another perspective on them.

> \* You won't be putting things online until the second week, so don't worry about that just yet

# Using GitHub

**Make a new repository called `data-studio-projects`.**

Each new project will go in a new folder. It's just like submitting homework - add your code, your data, your images, etc.

At the end of the project you will add a `README.md` to the folder describing what you did (methodology from the Google Doc, see below).

# Using the site

The site lives at [https://lede-mentorship.herokuapp.com](https://lede-mentorship.herokuapp.com)

If you haven't filled out a profile yet, you'll be prompted to do so. If you want to edit it later, you can click the **Edit Profile** link in the top right-hand corner.

## Setting up discussion times

Every week you'll automatically have a new project created and be assigned a new mentor.

When you scroll down to the week, you'll see information about your mentor, along with contact info.

After your mentor has suggested times, you'll see a notification at the top of the page to accept, along with some **Accept** buttons in the actual meeting section.

![](https://gist.github.com/jsoma/7a9fb58ba94ceca99fb6df4608307d4e/raw/f1409966b369d1215896c2a2eb5bbe2f9b3ac5ab/accept-buttons.png)

Click to accept a couple, and you'll be all set! You'll probably want to accept one earlier in the week and one later in the week.

As you accept them, they'll change color. After you accept two a notice will appear at the top of the page reminding you about your schedule times.

When the time comes, contact your mentor over their preferred medium (Skype, Hangouts, etc). And there you go!

### Adding more projects

Remember that 1.5 week project cycle I mentioned above? You can use the **add another** button to add more projects to discuss with your mentor. It will automatically share the Google Doc with them, and add it to their list.

**For example,** if you're talking on Monday, it's probably good to discuss:

1. The early stages of your new project
2. What came out of last week's project.

Even though you had a mentor last week, it's good to get another point of view, right?

> Please be respectful of your mentor's time! They're only scheduled for 30-minute talks, so keep an eye on the clock if you're talking for a while.
 
## Updating your project

Each week's project lives as a Google Doc that's shared between you and your mentor (although the mentor can only comment).

Scroll down to your project and click the Google Docs link to open it up.

You'll fill out the following fields to the best of your ability.

* **headline:** What is your project?
* **pitch:** Explain what your project is, along with goals and general ideas of finished product
* **datasets:** As you find datasets, drop links in here. Also explain the sources where they come from.
* **github_repo:**  you'll need to upload your code, PDFs, finished PNGs, etc, to a github repository. [Use Buzzfeed as a good example](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-01-tennis-betting-analysis).
* **published_url:** As the semester goes on you'll start to publish your work to the internet. This will link to those places.
* **discussion_topics:** What do you want to talk about concerning this project?
* **methodology:** Describe the steps you took so that someone else could reproduce your project. You don't need to [be ProPublica](https://static.propublica.org/projects/patient-safety/methodology/surgeon-level-risk-methodology.pdf), but you'll want to be as detailed as possible.
*  **content:** This is where your published piece will go! Images, text, all of that.
* The area at the bottom of the page, which you can use for anything
  
> Be careful to **not delete the `headline:`, `content:`, `:end` pieces**, or any of the highlighted parts. Everything will be sad and broken if you do that.

As you go through the week, you'll update both your code on GitHub as well as your Google Doc.

On the day of your meeting, your mentor will be reviewing everything in preparation for the meeting. **Be sure to push updates often so they have something to see!**
